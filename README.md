# Stats C161
Stats C161 is a graduate level course titled Introduction to Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, which I took under Professor Allie Fletcher in Spring of 2018. I have included my 5 homework assignments. Please do not copy your homework assignments from my code; I have simply posted my solutions to showcase my skills in Python. This class was equal parts frustrating as it was rewarding, and its merit showed when I earned an A in the class, after a lot of struggling.
