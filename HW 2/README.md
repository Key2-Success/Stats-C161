# HW 2
This assignment had two parts: a homework and a lab. The homework looked into the math behind bias, variance, likelihoods, estimates, models in matrix form, as well as classifying error rate of MAP. The lab followed a tutorial on feature selection for linear models in baseball salaries by using LASSO and visualizing the features of the LASSO and the LASSO path.
